The reaction is initiated by adding enzyme and incubating the mixture at 25° C. After 2 minutes of incubation, the reaction is terminated by adding 500 microliters of ice cold 30% (w/v) trichloroacetic acid.

In the compound screening assays, the reaction is composed of 5 uL of compound in 8-point serial dilutions with concentrations ranging from 0.0086 to 18.75 uM, 20 nM of purified enzyme, and 250 uM of p-NAD+ in the 1x Assay Buffer. After 60 min incubation at room temperature, the reactions were quenched by the addition of 10 uL of 5x quenching solution (20% formic acid and 500 nM [d]-nicotinamide in water). For the background control wells, 10 uL of the 5x quenching solution per well was added prior to the addition of p-NAD+. The % Inhibition was calculated as: (Control-Sample)/(Control-Background)*100. 'Control' is the average value of 8 wells without compound; and 'Background' is the average of 8 wells mixed with 5x quenching solution measured prior to initiation of the reaction.","",2015,"0",454.5,"1.68"

The reaction is initiated by adding enzyme and incubating the mixture at 25° C. After 2 minutes of incubation, the reaction is terminated by adding 500 microliters of ice cold 30% (w/v) trichloroacetic acid. The precipitate formed is transferred onto a glass fiber filter (Packard Unifilter-GF/C) and washed three times with 70% ethanol. After the filter is dried, the radioactivity is determined by scintillation counting.","",2014,"0",357.42,"3.09"

Pharmacol., 27, 617-622, 2005].Histone was coated on 384-well plate, which is a small volume PS plate (784101) of Greiner Bio-One, and left at 25 C. for 2 hours. After that, the plate was rinsed four times with PBS (7.5 mM Na2HPO4, 2.5 mM NaH2PO4, 145 mM NaCl, pH 7.4), and in order to prevent non-specific reaction, the Strep-diluent (provided from kit of Trevigen) was added and left at 25 C. for one hour. After one hour, the plate was again rinsed with PBS four times, and the compounds of the Examples in various concentrations were put into reactant containing PARP-1 enzyme (0.12 unit/well), 2x PARP cocktail.","",2014,"0",312.42,"1.63"

Concentration curves were prepared in MEM/10% FCS from compound stocks in dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO), and final DMSO concentration was 0.002% (v/v). Duplicate wells for each concentration point were prepared with a typical highest compound concentration of 20 μM and serial dilution 1:3. Plates were dried and fixed adding a cold methanol-acetone (70:30) solution for 15 min at RT; fixing solution was aspired and wells were air dried for 5 min and then dehydrated in PBS. Non-specific binding sites were blocked by incubating wells for 30 min in PBS containing 5% (w/v) FBS 0.05% Tween20. Wells were then incubated for 1 h at RT in PBS containing anti PAR mouse monoclonal antibody (Anti-PAR, Mouse mAb 10H, Tulip Cat No 1020) diluted 1:200 in blocking solution. After 3 washes in PBS, wells were incubated in PBS (w/v) 5% FBS 0.05% Tween20 containing 2 μg/mL Cy2-conjugated Goat anti mouse secondary antibody (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech cat. No PA 42002) (Absorption maximum 489 nm, fluorescence maximum 506 nm) and 1 μg/mL DAPI (Absorption maximum 359 nm, fluorescence maximum 461 nm) (4',6-diamidino-2-phenylindole dilactate) (Sigma cat. No D9564), a high sensitivity dye for nucleic acid staining. After washing further 3 times in PBS, cellular PAR immunoreactivity was assessed using the ArrayScan vTi instrument, with a Zeiss 10×0.5 N.A. objective, and applying the Cytotoxicity.V3 algorithm (Cellomics/Thermo Fisher) with a XF100 filter. At least 10 fields, corresponding to at least 900 cells, were read for each well.","",2016,"0",446.32,"4.03"

No D9564), a high sensitivity dye for nucleic acid staining. After washing further 3 times in PBS, cellular PAR immunoreactivity was assessed using the ArrayScan vTi instrument, with a Zeiss 10×0.5 N.A. objective, and applying the Cytotoxicity.V3 algorithm (Cellomics/Thermo Fisher) with a XF100 filter.

Test compounds were then added at the required concentration for 30 minutes. DNA damage was then induced adding hydrogen peroxide at the concentration of 0.1 mM for 15 minutes. Concentration curves were prepared in MEM/10% FCS from compound stocks in DMSO, and final DMSO concentration was 0.002% (v/v). Duplicate wells for each concentration point were prepared with a typical highest compound concentration of 20 uM and serial dilution 1:3. Plates were dried and fixed adding cold methanol-acetone (70:30) solution for 15 minutes at room temperature.","",2015,"0",354.45,"2.42"

Test compounds were then added at the required concentration for 30'. DNA damage was then induced adding hydrogen peroxide at the concentration of 0.1 mM for 15 min. Concentration curves were prepared in MEM/10% FCS from compound stocks in dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO), and final DMSO concentration was 0.002% (v/v). Duplicate wells for each concentration point were prepared with a typical highest compound concentration of 20 μM and serial dilution 1:3. Plates were dried and fixed adding a cold methanol-acetone (70:30) solution for 15 min at RT; fixing solution was aspired and wells were air dried for 5 min and then dehydrated in PBS. Non-specific binding sites were blocked by incubating wells for 30 min in PBS containing 5% (w/v) FBS 0.05% Tween20. Wells were then incubated for 1 h at RT in PBS containing anti PAR mouse monoclonal antibody (Anti-PAR, Mouse mAb 10H, Tulip Cat No 1020) diluted 1:200 in blocking solution. After 3 washes in PBS, wells were incubated in PBS (w/v) 5% FBS 0.05% Tween20 containing 2 μg/mL Cy2-conjugated Goat anti mouse secondary antibody (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech cat.

No D9564), a high sensitivity dye for nucleic acid staining. After washing further 3 times in PBS, cellular PAR immunoreactivity was assessed using the ArrayScan vTi instrument, with a Zeiss 10×0.5 N.A. objective, and applying the Cytotoxicity.V3 algorithm (Cellomics/Thermo Fisher) with a XF100 filter.

Duplicate wells for each concentration point were prepared with a typical highest compound concentration of 20 μM and serial dilution 1:3. Plates were dried and fixed adding a cold methanol-acetone (70:30) solution for 15 min at RT; fixing solution was aspired and wells were air dried for 5 min and then dehydrated in PBS. Non-specific binding sites were blocked by incubating wells for 30 min in PBS containing 5% (w/v) FBS 0.05% Tween20. Wells were then incubated for 1 h at RT in PBS containing anti PAR mouse monoclonal antibody (Anti-PAR, Mouse mAb 10H, Tulip Cat No 1020) diluted 1:200 in blocking solution. After 3 washes in PBS, wells were incubated in PBS (w/v) 5% FBS 0.05% Tween20 containing 2 μg/mL Cy2-conjugated Goat anti mouse secondary antibody (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech cat. No PA 42002) (Absorption maximum 489 nm, fluorescence maximum 506 nm) and 1 μg/mL DAPI (Absorption maximum 359 nm, fluorescence maximum 461 nm) (4',6-diamidino-2-phenylindole dilactate) (Sigma cat. No D9564), a high sensitivity dye for nucleic acid staining. After washing further 3 times in PBS, cellular PAR immunoreactivity was assessed using the ArrayScan vTi instrument, with a Zeiss 10×0.5 N.A. objective, and applying the Cytotoxicity.V3 algorithm (Cellomics/Thermo Fisher) with a XF100 filter. At least 10 fields, corresponding to at least 900 cells, were read for each well.","",2016,"0",346.33,"2.82"
